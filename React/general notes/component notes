## React mapping and unique key issue

React will not be going through the entire array to check for a key

When React goes through an array, it only looks at the things directly in it. It doesn't recurse all the way through looking for a key. If it did, it would (1) be slow, and (2) cause ambiguity when there were nested arrays.
If you use a map, just put the key in the outer most layer

if you have fragments

# WRONG
<>
    <div key= {}> </div>
</>

# RIGHT
    <div key= {}> </div>

This will cause an issue, rather you want to remove the fragments. As long as, the outer most element has the key, it will work
