mx-auto - margin on the x-axis on both left and right side are equal
sm:hidden - sm is a breakpoint and if the breakpoint is hit, hide the burger menu

flex: all horizontal elements are now part of flex box
    - justify between - all elements will start to expand from the middle of the screen
    - item-center align the elements along the center of the y axis

flex-col - same as flex but now all elements are stack on top of one another, great for making forms


mx-auto - centering div automatically relative to its parents, not the content within
    mx-auto, you will need to set the max-width of the container as it only work with fixed width
        - max-w-2xl
        - w-40

To align the contents within a div and not the div itself:
    text-center to align the content in the center of the div

If icon does not align, use flex to make them individual flex box then use justify center
