Qns: Posting using axios causes re-render and state to be lost
Ans: e.preventDefault()
prevent the page from reloading and unmounting the component when submitting the form (default html behaviour), this prevents state from being lost


// Please return your axios or else your await will have issues




// How are we going to manage errors from http request and how are we going to create a error handling middleware to response to the different sort
of error and pass on the correct message to the user?
do we use error codes?

and maintain the error code on both side?

we need to pass down the error to trigger the try catch block in another place.


// max call this is because of the hook is referencing itself



// typing in input causes onChange which causes a re-render which retriggers all the hooks


// Do we want the httplogin user to interact with redux or do you want to do it in the login page??
we will perform all the necessary actions in the loginpage because from a new comer, the logic thing to findAllTabs all the login logic
is in the login page as opposed to the auth api
like in angular where we only access the service when we want to post things out



// There are always libraries that you will discover that improves your coding experience
like yup, the question is to implement it in the normal react way or the lib way?

we will do it the normal way and implement with new libraries in the future once we are comfortable with react



// Clean appearing code by abstracting the components into render functions
// Abstracting halfway will make it very untidy but if you do not abstract, it gets very very long winded
// Find a way to abstract all the html div, sections and abstract the functions

// keep the final render very short so it gives an overview
// not all functions has to have its own render functions, as it would be too abstracted. rather keep render functions for mapping
// a good way to see is to use, https://github.com/radzionc/reactkit/blob/main/package.json, his abstractions are very good



// Everything i update the auth property, i have to change the code in multiple different places
// authSlice.service, authslice.ts, loginPage, loginNavPage
