Qns: Posting using axios causes re-render and state to be lost
Ans: e.preventDefault()
prevent the page from reloading and unmounting the component when submitting the form (default html behaviour), this prevents state from being lost


// Please return your axios or else your await will have issues




// How are we going to manage errors from http request and how are we going to create a error handling middleware to response to the different sort
of error and pass on the correct message to the user?
do we use error codes?

and maintain the error code on both side?

we need to pass down the error to trigger the try catch block in another place.


// max call this is because of the hook is referencing itself



// typing in input causes onChange which causes a re-render which retriggers all the hooks


// Do we want the httplogin user to interact with redux or do you want to do it in the login page??
we will perform all the necessary actions in the loginpage because from a new comer, the logic thing to find all the login logic
is in the login page as opposed to the auth api
like in angular where we only access the service when we want to post things out
