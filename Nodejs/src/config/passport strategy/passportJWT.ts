/*
 * Passport documentation is not good. Don't refer to that. This file's purpose is to configure/transform the passportObj
 * to a specific mode (JWT/local/FB/Google etc) when the server starts.
 *
 * This is done by creating the base passport strategy object in app.js
 * -- const passport strategy = require('passport strategy');
 *
 * Then call the following in app.js
 * -- require('./config/passport strategy')(passport strategy);
 *
 * By doing this, you are passing the passportObj into the function below.
 * What this does is that it will set the settings in "passport strategy" to the jwtOptions
 * such as allowing it to take the jwttoken from the authorization header and allow it to decode the jwt token based on a certain algo
 *
 * Afterwards, the passport strategy requires the auth object to compare the jwttoken that it received from the request
 * It will perform an internal comparison and return a true or false with res.status
 *
 * To findAllTabs the value of this comparison, use the middlewares, passport strategy.authenticate('jwt', {session: false})
 * put this statement before the routes to perform the authentication
 *
 * The main reason why this is automatically triggered for all request is that passport strategy wants to give the developer flexibility
 * Not all routes require authentication, if this is triggered for all routes, people will have to create an account just to view anything and
 * the resources is gated behind an account.
 *
 * Note that passport strategy does not issue a JWT, or isRefresh token, create your auth for you, it does not even attached the jwt token to your header.
 * You have to do this yourself. The passport strategy only authenticates existing tokens which means that the first login you will have to issue a JWT token before you can run the passport strategy authenticate middlewares
 * This is all define by the developer and their own ways. passport strategy just authenticates based on a certain requirement and simply return yes or no to proceed forward.
 *

/*
 * Creating a new strategy
 * parameter 1: options
 * parameter 2: Jwt will perform run some functions and pass in the information into the (payload, next) as arguments
 *
 * What goes on in JWT Strategy is that it performs JWT checking by comparing the signed version with the incoming JWT token
 * Which if not for this lib, we will have to manually do it,

     The first parameter check if there is an error with the auth process
