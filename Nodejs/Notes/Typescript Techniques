 // By doing this authTO interface completes the object for you.

 export interface AuthTOProps {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    emailAddress: string;
    username: string;
    password: string;
    refreshToken: string;
    accessToken: string;
}

I can't create an authTO object using = new authTO
because authTO is an interface and not a class.

// This is how you create an authTO object using the interface.
const authTO: AuthTOProps = {
    refreshToken: refreshToken,
    accessToken: accessToken
} as AuthTOProps



In Java you can do this

Animal tiger = new Tiger();

This would be valid where the tiger is an animal object
and you are creating it using the constructor of the Tiger class.

but in typescript, this is not possible.

How do you create an instance of something using the constructor of a class
when the class is not a class but an interface?
