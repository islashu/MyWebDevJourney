Welcome, this is my personal web development website

It encompasses my entire knowledge on web development, algorithms and data structure.

I will go through every part of my progress of creating this website in detail.

This project will also serve to document my life and the hardships that I have experience 
as a Chemistry major turned software developer.

Thank you.
